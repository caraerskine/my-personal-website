# My Personal Website
My first website that I have designed and built, May 2022. I am a Software Engineering Flex candidate
at the Flatiron School. I am an artist and electrician and wanted to transmute those skills into 
software engineering. Here goes!

This responsive grid layout has always been visually intriguing to me. It reads a little like 
the game "Memory" from the 1980s and I want to have a mouseover event on each photo to reveal
a memory or an interesting text anecdote. The photos are pop cultural, art and sports pictures
of people and events that are important to me or that I love, so it is visual and slightly
sentimental, but that makes sense given my artistic sensibility.

The code style is HTML, CSS and JS. I am probably describing that wrong!
