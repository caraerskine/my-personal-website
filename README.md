# My Personal Website
My first website that I have designed and built, May 2022. I am a Software Engineering Flex candidate
at the Flatiron School. I am an artist and electrician and wanted to transmute those skills into 
software engineering. Here goes!

This responsive grid layout has always been visually intriguing to me. It reads a little like 
the game "Memory" from the 1980s and I want to have a mouseover event on each photo to reveal
a memory or an interesting text anecdote about myself. The photos are pop cultural, art and sports pictures
of people and events that are important to me or that I love, so it is visual and slightly
sentimental, but that makes sense given my artistic sensibility. I want the user to be able to meander
over the page and get information, but not be overloaded with a lot of text off the bat. I think sort of
"nesting" it in the images is a cool way to get information.

The code style is HTML, CSS and JS. I am probably describing that wrong!

A goal of mine is to have another mouseover event where the images and texts can also be like the backs
of the "Memory" game cards. I am trying to figure out how to incorporate that. I want it to almost be 
like flipping a card over, in a sense. 

As I am able to, I will update this with more technical info!
